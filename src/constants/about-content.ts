    "The Elite Quality Index (EQx) is a political economy index that measures and ranks countries on the basis of their elite quality. Elite quality is understood as the aggregate impact of elite business models as they lead to value creation (positive) or rent seeking (negative). High quality elites maximize a country's inclusive economic and human development in the long run. The EQx is a comparative, international measurement of Elites.",

        "We present the first ever international measurement of Elite Quality. However, EQx does not measure elites directly; instead, it assesses the actual degree of value creation of their business models as reflected in macro and micro data-sets. We believe that the more value-creation and less rent seeking take place, the higher the levels of inclusive economic and human development the nation will achieve in the future.",
